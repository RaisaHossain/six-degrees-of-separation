Assignment: Lab 06 Three Degrees of Kevin Bacon
File: report.txt
Test cases for ThreeDegrees.java main function:

1. Check what happens when two strings of the same value are entered:
expectation: distanceTo = 0, print output: "Silly! They are in their own movie!"
    i)filename : mymovies.txt
    ii)actor names: vertex 1= Kevin Bacon, vertex 2= Kevin Bacon
    iii)actual output: "Silly! They are in their own movie!"

2. Check what happens if either the first or second name is the empty string
expectation: (the user hit enter giving no name), then the program should end
    i)filename : mymovies.txt
    ii)actor names: vertex 1= "", vertex 2= Kevin Bacon
    iii)actual output: Process finished with exit code 0

3. Check what happens If either name is not found in the graph,
expectation: the program should print a message to that effect, and
request two new names for the next search.
    i)filename : mymovies.txt
    ii)actor names:vertex 1= Joe, vertex 2= Kevin Bacon
    iii)actual output: Joe is not known in the moviefiles/movies-0.txt
                       Enter first actor's name (two case-senstive words):

4.Check for short distance (<= 3) paths
expectation: normal operation
    i)filename : mymovies.txt
    ii)actor names:vertex 1= Tom Cruise, vertex 2= Tom Hanks
    iii)actual output: Tom Cruise was in AFewGoodMen
                       with Kevin Bacon who was in Apollo13
                       with Tom Hanks.

5.Check for long distance ( > 3) paths
expectation: distanceTo > 3; chain exceeds max length of 3
    i)filename : mymovies.txt
    ii)actor names:vertex 1= Ian McKellen, vertex 2= John Cusack
    iii)actual output: No path less than or equal to a 3-hop distance exists between Ian McKellen and John Cusack
                       Enter first actor's name (two case-senstive words):

6. Check for max distance (==3) paths
expectation: normal operation
    i)filename : mymovies.txt
    ii)actor names:vertex 1= Josh Brolin, vertex 2= Ian McKellen
    iii)actual output: Josh Brolin was in HollowMan
                       with Kevin Bacon who was in Apollo13
                       with Tom Hanks who was in DaVinciCode
                       with Ian McKellen.
